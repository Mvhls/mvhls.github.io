		<h1 id= "header1" class="padding">My Take on Pairing</h1>
		<p class="padding">Pairing plays an important part of learning how to program. It is faster when working in groups, and this was obvious each time I had paired. We accomplished each task faster than we usually would, and I have learned important skills from other people. I enjoy this aspect of collaboration, but I feel sometimes working over long distances can be frustrating. There are good tools, like stypi and google hangout, that make it less so, but sometimes it might be simple using one computer to accomplish the tasks and challenges. I have paired a over 6 times in the last three weeks, and every meeting I learned something different. Each person will have a different aspect or view on approaching a problem. I find this to be the most rewarding way to learn, especially in programming since there is always more than one way to solve a problem. </p>
		<p class="padding">During most of my pairing sessions, there we worked in driver-navigator roles. The other time we had more specific roles of either writing user stories, pseudo code, code or refactoring roles. There is more interaction in a driver-navigator pair, but the latter is friendly to larger groups. Each has their pros and cons, but they both have similarities. It is easy to learn in groups where people are able to share their experiences and willing to teach each other. Every experience I had with pairing was positive and I have learned so much. This early into dev boot camp, people are still inexperienced and much to learn. I remember working on the code combat exercises and contemplating with another person the best way to solve the problem. The hardest part was narrowing down the different ways we could, but when I was working on it alone I only had one idea. Having multiple aspects will be imperative in the future when there are harder challenges, and knowing how to communicate properly is the key to crossing those barriers.</p>
