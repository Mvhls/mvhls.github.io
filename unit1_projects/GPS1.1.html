      <h1>Pair Programming</h1>
      <p>Pair programming is used in many places. It is used at meetups, at work and even in the early stages when learning to code. At dev boot camp, pair programming is an important part.</p>
      <p>Pair programming is a collaboration of two people who code on the same screen. Usually there will be one person driving and one person navigating. The driver is the person who will be sitting at the computer typing the program, and the navigator will be guiding the driver and telling them what he should be typing. The programmers will often switch roles throughout this process.</p>
      <p>There are multiple reasons why this type of collaboration is beneficial. When two people are working together, it is easier to spot errors in the program. The overall time spent figuring out why a part is not working the intentional way can be significantly less. Two different people will bring different experiences to the problem, which will also make learning  easier. Another problem paired programming solves is complacency. People working together will be more active in solving the problem and not so much be wasting time. All of these benefits lead to increased learning and more experience in a collaborative working environment.</p>
      <p>During the first guided paring session, Philip, Tim and I learned a bunch of tips from each other. We figured out how to fix the margins and better understand responsive web design. We spotted errors that would have taken longer to fix, and learned how to style html in three different ways. I feel that pairing is an excellent way to learn how to code during dev bootcamp.</p>
