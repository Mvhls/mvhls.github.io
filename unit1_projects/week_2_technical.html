		<h2 class="h2">What are they?</h2><br>
		<p>Classes and ids are two different css selectors used for Internal and external styling of an Html file.</p><br>
		<p style="color:red;">In order to make text red, you could set the color of the text to red using inline styling, but what if you only wanted only a specific word to be blue? In order to do this, along with many other things, you would need to use classes and ids. Classes and ids are useful to apply specific styling to elements. If the element is given a class or id, the styling can be done internally between style brackets, or more importantly, in a separate CSS stylesheet. between the brackets of an element, you would write: class="class/id name", and then style the same way you would inline on either a separate css file or internally between style brackets in the header. This is beneficial to reuse code on different html files and saving time, but what is the difference between classes and ids?</p><br>
		<h2 class="h2">Classes vs. IDs</h2><br>
		<p>Classes and ids do the same thing with respect to styling, but classes can be used on more than one element, while ids are only used on one specific element and cannot be used again. If you wanted to set two paragraphs a certain font, a class can be made for a specifc font and then applied to those paragraph elements, but this would cause an error if you applied an id to more than one element. If you only needed to apply a style to one element, an id could be used. For example, a class was used on the h2 elements on this page to make the font larger in size, while ids were used for the header, footer and body of the page because there is only one specific design for each of them.</p><br>
