		<p>Object oriented programming should be easy to talk about because I have been learning ruby. I do not have much experience with functional programming, so it can be difficult to relate to OOP.  With ruby, everything is an object, and problems are approached and solved with objects. In OOP, or imperative programming,  programs are composed of statements which can change the global state when executed. Also, data in imperative languages can be mutable, which means the overall state of a function can be changed. For example, the statement,  x = x+1, is not logical, but in ruby it means that it is adding +1 to whatever x was originally. Functional programming involves using functions are used in the fundamental idea, not objects, and is used to reduce the complexity of the program. Recursion and pattern matching are some of the tools used in functional programming. Many programming languages have the ability to write both functional and imperative programs. The difference being the syntax, libraries and other conventions will usually make it easier to program in one or the other. Functional programming deals with side effects by working  with immutable data, and not changing data. Functional code is usually shorter and easier to understand than imperative code, and in turn will increase productivity.</p>
