		<p class="padding">Javascript is an object oriented programming language that is often used on web pages to make them more interactive and dynamic. It was developed by Brendan Eich as a scripting language with similar syntax to java and C languages.</p>
		<p class="padding">So why is javascript used on web pages? Well it is a scripting language that depends on a browser or other host environment in order to run. By embedding javascript within html, different types of functionality are added to web pages. Paragraphs on a web page are considered static, while different menu styles, graphic displays and even advertisement are considered dynamic. This is what javascript has to offer to liven up any web page.</p>
		<p class="padding">So why is it a scripted programming language? The html document along with javascript is sent and interpreted by the browser on the client's machine. The code is then executed on the client's machine when the web page is either loaded, or whenever the link is activated. There can be many possibilities when a person interacts with the web page. Different types of buttons, or even different types of graphical user interfaces can be made while using it as a scripting language. Although there are different types of scripting languages that can be used to make web pages, javascript's usability and simplicity to use make it a great language to work with on the web. </p>
