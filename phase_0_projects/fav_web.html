<p class="padding">This was my news website that I visited at work, and it never occured to me how well it was designed. It is probably the most complicated-looking website on my list. The websitie has beautifully formatted pictures linked to specific articles. Your eyes are immediately drawn to the largest picture, which happens to be the biggest story. For a serious site, I enjoy the color design and it's interesting features. It has multiple sidebars, headers and tabs. From a design perspective, my favorite feature is the top tabs. They are all different colors and when you change to a different news topic (a different link) the whole page slides, but if you choose a tab that is not directly next to the one you are currently looking at, it will slide past all the other pages! At this point in my learning experience, that makes me feel overwhelmed, but I would eventually love to work on a website like this with all its features.</p>
<a class="padding link" href="http://www.pandora.com"/><h3>Pandora.com</h3></a>
<p class="padding">As complicated at this site may be with audio plugins and a method of sorting songs based on user preference, the design is very simple and easy to use. There is not much on the page, and you are drawn to the album picture of what band is playing, probably the most important for users. They must know that everyone will have this site playing in on a page in the background while doing other things. The interaction from a user can be as simple as skipping to the next track, and simple is important. No one would use this site if they had to skim to find the play and pause buttons, or find out what music was playing. With just one header at the top of the page and a small, centered body, this page is simple looking. Most of the complication is done on the back end. I couldn't imagine the time and lines of code needed to create an interactive music player that can match songs based on previous user choices. That is why this site has always inspired me; a basic, yet pretty layout with powerful applications.</p>
<a class="padding link" href="http://youtube.com"/><h3>Youtube.com</h3></a>
<p class="padding">Everyone knows what it is. Everyone has used it! I find myself using this site too much not to comment on it, so I feel I need to! For anyone living under a rock, Youtube is a site that shows user-uploaded videos, and is one of the most used video sites, if not the most. This site changes often, but usually for the better. I see two things when I open up this page and they are both important. I first see the search bar on top of an the page.  This site is always full of pictures of links to videos, but the top of the page is empty and boring with just one search bar. I feel this emptiness is important so it is easy for users to find the search bar in a hurry. The second thing I pay attention to is the scrolling list of pictures that fill up the rest of the page. When signed in, this is a list of videos from users that you are subscribed to. These features are what makes it easy to do what the majority  of people do when visiting; search for a specific video, or watch videos similar to their interests. The site is really simple, and practical which seems like a feature that most high-volume sites have in common. There is one sidebar, header and footer on this page, and it is all the site needs to function. I like that some features like google notifications have been added to this page since google has bought them out. One of the most interesting features from a business perspective is the connectivity between all the different sites people use. That is also very practical and important, if not what most businesses are trying to accomplish with their technologies.</p>
