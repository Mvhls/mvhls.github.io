		<p>I have not heard of stereotype threat, but it is a very logical explanation. It is easy to understand how people who believe they will underperform due in an area where they are stereotypically underestimated.  I have had an experience in school where I felt stereotype threat. Upon entering college, I was faced with the negative stereotype of having a low socioeconomic background, as I would be the first person in my family to receive a college degree. I felt I was at a disadvantage of not having parents or other role models to aid me with guidance while making my way through college. There are some advantages to receiving advice from parents or siblings on what to expect and what types of situations to avoid, and I felt I let that bring me down, especially around my junior year when looking for internships. A lot of my classmates had internships through their parents employers, which was upsetting to me when I could not find one. It bogged me down, and I was completely convinced I would not have an internship or any undergraduate research experience because I did not have or make those connections, so I stopped looking.  Looking back, I would have been more successful if that negative stereotype did not bother me, as there were plenty of opportunities to find work. I would like to remember to encourage other people, and myself, to deemphasize threatening social identities, as it can only be harmful to think in that manner. </p>
