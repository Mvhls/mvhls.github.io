		<p class="padding">This week I will be discussing Arrays and hashes. Arrays and hashes are ways to group collections of different sets of data. In ruby, they can hold all types of objects, and are even objects themselves. Although they are similar in that aspect, they serve different purposes and have many different attributes. I will be explaining the differences between them here.</p>
		<p class="padding">Arrays are the more basic type of data storage. They have a simple bracket notation with each object separated by commas. Anything from a string, integer and even another array can be stored inside the array. Each position in the array is given an index value starting at 0. Order is important in an array, because if an objects position is changed, It will have a different index value. For this reason, order is important.  When you need a specific object from the array, you call the specific index that the object is being held in. A new array can be made and populated at the same time, or objects can be added to an already existing one. </p>
		<p class="padding">Hashes are the more complex type of data storage. data is held between braces or "curly brackets" and data is also separated by commas. All types of data can be stored inside hashes, including other hashes. The difference between arrays and hashes is their distinct key value pairing. Both the keys and values of hashes can be objects, where each object in an array is assigned to a temporary index. This makes ordering sometimes less important. No matter where it is positioned in the hash, a key will always have the same value.  Just like with arrays, hashes can be made and populated easily, or added to. One thing to keep in mind is that every key must be unique, but values can be duplicated.</p>
		<p class="padding">Although arrays and hashes can to some of the same things, one is usually the best for any specific situation. When deciding which one is needed, there are several different reasons one is better than the other. Hashes are important when an identifier is needed for a piece of data. For instance, usernames and passwords can easily be stored inside a hash. Each unique username can be stored as a key and the password can be stored in a value. Same with phone numbers. Arrays can be used when the order of data is important. In order to calculate the mean or median of a group of objects, an array is definitely a better choice.</p>
